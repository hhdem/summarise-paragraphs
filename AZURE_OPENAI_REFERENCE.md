## Code Examples

### Python Example: Using Azure OpenAI Service for Text Summarization

```python
from openai import AzureOpenAI

# Initialize Azure OpenAI client
client = AzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    api_version="2023-07-01-preview"
)

# Call Azure OpenAI API for text summarization
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    deployment_id=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that summarizes text. Provide a concise summary of the given text."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Text content to summarize..."}
    ],
    max_tokens=150,
    temperature=0.5,
)

summary = response.choices[0].message.content
```

### Environment Variables Setup

```
# Azure OpenAI Configuration
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_api_key_here

```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What's the difference between Azure OpenAI Service and OpenAI API?

Azure OpenAI Service is a collaboration between Microsoft and OpenAI that runs OpenAI models on the Azure platform. Key differences include:

- **Data Privacy**: Azure OpenAI doesn't use your data to train models (unless you explicitly opt in)
- **Compliance**: Provides Azure's enterprise-grade security and compliance certifications
- **Regional Deployment**: Can be deployed in specific Azure regions to meet data residency requirements
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with other Azure services (like Azure Active Directory)
- **Enterprise Support**: Provides Microsoft's enterprise-grade support

### 2. How do I get access to Azure OpenAI Service?

Azure OpenAI Service requires application for access. You need to:

1. Have a valid Azure subscription
2. Fill out the application form: [Azure OpenAI Service Access Request](https://aka.ms/oai/access)
3. Wait for approval (typically takes a few days to weeks)
4. Once approved, you can create Azure OpenAI resources in the Azure portal

### 3. What models does Azure OpenAI Service support?

Azure OpenAI Service offers various OpenAI models, including but not limited to:

- GPT-4 (various variants)
- GPT-3.5 Turbo (various variants)
- Embeddings models (like text-embedding-ada-002)
- DALL-E (image generation)

Available models may vary by region and will be updated over time.

### 4. How do I monitor Azure OpenAI Service usage and costs?

You can monitor usage and costs through:

- Azure OpenAI Studio in the Azure portal
- Azure Monitor and Application Insights
- Azure Cost Management + Billing

## Best Practices

1. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting in your client applications to avoid exceeding Azure OpenAI Service quota limits

2. **Use Asynchronous Processing**: For high-traffic applications, use asynchronous processing to handle API requests

3. **Implement Retry Logic**: Add exponential backoff retry logic to handle temporary service disruptions

4. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly monitor API usage to avoid unexpected costs

5. **Optimize Prompts**: Carefully design system prompts to get better results and reduce token usage

6. **Implement Caching**: For common queries, implement result caching to reduce API calls

7. **Use Content Filtering**: Leverage Azure OpenAI's content filtering capabilities to ensure safe and appropriate content generation
